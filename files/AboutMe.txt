Hi, my name is Nitai Gauramani

I am a 19-year-old software developer studying at Ecole 42.

I am passionate about computer science, music, and other
creative fields. I came to Paris to pursue my dreams in tech while also exploring my
interests in the multi-cultural world that Paris offers. Being in a city where
creativity and style are everywhere has inspired me to seek opportunities to
connect, learn, and be part of these industries. Iâ€™m eager to find experiences that
let me combine my love for these fields.
